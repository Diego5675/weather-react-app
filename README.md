## Overview

![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37351280/132419105-3305f757-2c3b-4a34-8496-d3ada3ca29ec.png)

- [Demo](https://dpasch-weather-app.vercel.app/)

I was able to build a project with my React.js knowledge so far with a Weather application using the [waetherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/) API to complete the challenge.

What I learned was how to use browsers [Web Navigator API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator) to use users current location and how to save data to [localStorage Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to save user city searches.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)

- Can see the weather of my current location.
- Can search weather for city.
- Can see weather of today and the next 5 days.
- Can see the date and location of the weather.
